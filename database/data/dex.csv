1.1.png,One of the first Fusion Pokémon documented in Kanto. Research suggests it photosynthesizes at quadruple the rate of a typical Bulbasaur.,fixthewifi
1.1.png,A Bulbasaur that has gone halfway through evolution. They tend to be aggressive with anything that approaches their seed.,Shuichi_le_sushi
1.1.png,It has a striking resemblance to its evolution. Scientists say that the fusion has caused unexpected growth in its DNA to create this appearance.,Soup1900
1.10.png,"The bud on its head blooms as it matures, with the petals drooping down to form a brittle carapace over time.",kandyman
1.100.png,"Despite their spherical appearance, POKENAME are unable to properly roll to travel. The bulbs on their backs store the electricity that powers them, so they would rather hop than risk damaging it.",Wildheartrazorfangs
1.101.png,"POKENAME excitedly run about on their short legs. Their lack of balance doesn't hinder them; when they fall, they simply roll back onto their feet. If their bulbs touch the ground, they release an explosion of sparks.",Wildheartrazorfangs
1.102.png,"POKENAME function as a hivemind of seeds from the same plant. Their bodies are divided into faces and bulbs, with the faces handling navigation and fighting, while the bulbs gather energy.",Wildheartrazorfangs
1.103.png,"The leaves atop POKENAME sprout from a single bulb, creating a miniature ecosystem within its body. The three heads communicate telepathically, with its leaves extending outward to repel anyone who interrupts them.",Wildheartrazorfangs
1.104.png,"POKENAME wear clay skulls to honor their Bulbasaur ancestors, decorating them with flowers to celebrate life. They wield vines from their bulbs as whips, striking hard enough to carve into the ground.",Wildheartrazorfangs
1.105.png,"With masterful vine control, POKENAME carve tunnels or pull fallen trees to create shelter. Their decorative skulls crack as they mature, reflecting the blooming of their bulbs as they grow into warriors.",Wildheartrazorfangs
1.106.png,"A POKENAME's limbs are made of coiled vines, allowing them to extend for greater reach or powerful leaps. POKENAME are proud fighters, but in kicking matches, their legs often tangle together.",Wildheartrazorfangs

1.136.png,"Living in tropical climates, POKENAME use their leafy tails and manes to absorb energy from sunlight and store it in their bulbs. The excess energy from their photosynthesis runs hot, allowing them to produce flame from their bulbs.",Wildheartrazorfangs
1.137.png,"Said to have been programmed to help create digital landscapes, POKENAME float through fields to plant seeds. While the seeds are completely organic, POKENAME always seem to buzz in an odd chorus of five notes whenever they start their work.",Wildheartrazorfangs
1.138.png,"A POKENAME's shell is made out of chloroplasts, allowing the body to constantly gain energy from photosynthesis even when hiding within them. The additional weight of the shell causes POKENAME to tire out more frequently.",Wildheartrazorfangs
