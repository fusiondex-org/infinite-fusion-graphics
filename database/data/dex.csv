1.1.png,One of the first Fusion Pokémon documented in Kanto. Research suggests it photosynthesizes at quadruple the rate of a typical Bulbasaur.,fixthewifi
1.1.png,A Bulbasaur that has gone halfway through evolution. They tend to be aggressive with anything that approaches their seed.,Shuichi_le_sushi
1.1.png,It has a striking resemblance to its evolution. Scientists say that the fusion has caused unexpected growth in its DNA to create this appearance.,Soup1900
1.10.png,"The bud on its head blooms as it matures, with the petals drooping down to form a brittle carapace over time.",kandyman
1.100.png,"Despite their spherical appearance, POKENAME are unable to properly roll to travel. The bulbs on their backs store the electricity that powers them, so they would rather hop than risk damaging it.",Wildheartrazorfangs
1.101.png,"POKENAME excitedly run about on their short legs. Their lack of balance doesn't hinder them; when they fall, they simply roll back onto their feet. If their bulbs touch the ground, they release an explosion of sparks.",Wildheartrazorfangs
1.102.png,"POKENAME function as a hivemind of seeds from the same plant. Their bodies are divided into faces and bulbs, with the faces handling navigation and fighting, while the bulbs gather energy.",Wildheartrazorfangs
1.103.png,"The leaves atop POKENAME sprout from a single bulb, creating a miniature ecosystem within its body. The three heads communicate telepathically, with its leaves extending outward to repel anyone who interrupts them.",Wildheartrazorfangs
1.104.png,"POKENAME wear clay skulls to honor their Bulbasaur ancestors, decorating them with flowers to celebrate life. They wield vines from their bulbs as whips, striking hard enough to carve into the ground.",Wildheartrazorfangs
1.105.png,"With masterful vine control, POKENAME carve tunnels or pull fallen trees to create shelter. Their decorative skulls crack as they mature, reflecting the blooming of their bulbs as they grow into warriors.",Wildheartrazorfangs
1.106.png,"A POKENAME's limbs are made of coiled vines, allowing them to extend for greater reach or powerful leaps. POKENAME are proud fighters, but in kicking matches, their legs often tangle together.",Wildheartrazorfangs
1.107.png,"While POKENAME possess incredible punching strength, they prefer meditating in sunlight to fighting. When forced to fight, they wrap vines around their fists to cushion the first blow as a warning shot.",Wildheartrazorfangs 
1.108.png,"POKENAME grab berry bushes with their long tongues and shake them to gather all of the berries. Their tongues contain saliva with special nectar that helps plants grow, resulting in more frequent berry supplies.",Wildheartrazorfangs

1.135.png,"Living deep within rainforests, POKENAME use their bulbs to store energy from electricity instead of sunlight. They run across treetops during storms, acting as lightning rods to catch stray bolts before they can strike trees.",Wildheartrazorfangs
1.136.png,"Living in tropical climates, POKENAME use their leafy tails and manes to absorb energy from sunlight and store it in their bulbs. The excess energy from their photosynthesis runs hot, allowing them to produce flame from their bulbs.",Wildheartrazorfangs
1.137.png,"Said to have been programmed to help create digital landscapes, POKENAME float through fields to plant seeds. While the seeds are completely organic, POKENAME always seem to buzz in an odd chorus of five notes whenever they start their work.",Wildheartrazorfangs
1.138.png,"A POKENAME's shell is made out of chloroplasts, allowing the body to constantly gain energy from photosynthesis even when hiding within them. The additional weight of the shell causes POKENAME to tire out more frequently.",Wildheartrazorfangs
1.139.png,"POKENAME use their vines to help carry their shells during travel or protect them during photosynthesis. If their shells ever crack, they will shoot off spiny seeds as both a defense mechanism and a way to grow a new one.",Wildheartrazorfangs

1.142.png,"POKENAME spread their wings high in the sky to absorb sunlight, casting a fearsome shadow below them. It is believed that these Pokémon ruled ancient forests from the treetops, their piercing cries causing leaves to fall from trees.",Wildheartrazorfangs
1.143.png,"POKENAME wander through forests to gather as many berries as they can. Whatever they don't eat is stored in their bulbs for later. If a POKENAME gets tired before their next meal, they will share the berries with smaller Pokémon before they sleep.",Wildheartrazorfangs
1.144.png,"Said to appear on the first or last day of winter, POKENAME's spores can either help collect or clear snow. The frost that POKENAME creates can preserve plants through the winter, allowing them to grow back stronger the following spring. ",Wildheartrazorfangs
1.145.png,"POKENAME flies cloaked in storm clouds, charging its bulb with lightning before producing radiant beams when the storm clears. These concentrated beams of energy will accelerate the growth of plants they touch.",Wildheartrazorfangs
1.146.png,"Said to have been brought to life from a stray sprout caught in a wildfire, POKENAME gathers fire along its wings to redirect it away from nature. Once cloaked in flame, POKENAME will emit light to aid in photosynthesis in its environment.",Wildheartrazorfangs
